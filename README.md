# Choosing the Right Data Science Services in Azure
Microsoft Azure offers a multitude of cloud-based products that simplify the data science workflow in unique ways. Together these products each have different purposes that help the data scientist with various aspects of the machine learning process.

This repository contains materials for the presentation _Choosing the Right Data Science Services_. In the presentation, we unpack the challenge in determining which product is best suited for each task. We also explore the most popular machine learning products on Azure and describe how each fit into a typical data science workflow.

We also explore how to right-size your data science team to best utilize each Azure machine learning product so youâ€™re efficiently solving problems as quickly and cheaply as possible.

By the end of this session, you should understand how to choose the set of Azure machine learning products that fit your data science team within a typical data science workflow, allowing them to scale, automate, and deploy a machine learning process with ease.

## Goal
Choose the right Azure machine learning products and services that allow your team to minimally build, deploy, and operationalize your AI and ML models quickly and cheaply.

### Machine Learning Options on Azure

 - Azure Machine Learning Service (Preview)
 - Azure Machine Learning Studio (Classic)
 - Azure Databricks
 - Azure Data Science Virtual Machine
 - SQL Server Machine Learning Services

There are five machine learning options on Azure that allow data analysts, data engineers, data scientists, and AI engineers work collaboratively on AI and ML models. 

Two of these products -- Azure Machine Learning Service (Preview) and Azure Databricks -- allow you to build models from the ground up. The materials in this repository focus on the services within these two products.
