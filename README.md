Microsoft Azure offers a multitude of cloud-based products that simplify creating solutions that solve your analytical problems with machine learning and AI. Together these products help your team with all aspects of the data science process.

With _Choosing the Right Data Science Services in Azure: Scale, Automate, and Deploy with Ease_, we unpack the challenge in determining which Azure data science product is best suited to solve your analytical problems. We explore the most popular machine learning and AI products and describe how each fit into a typical machine learning workflow.

Our <a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/documents/embeddedchart/acf9aa5d-a85f-4786-bf56-e49a88a63bac" target="_blank">machine learning workflow</a>
covers the full lifecycle of the data science process from data acquisition to scaling and serving finished models on production systems. Within each of the tasks in the process, we explore the right Azure products that help us easily scale our solutions.

We also explore how to right-size <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emdata-design/azure-data-science/master/assets/Ideal%20Data%20Science%20Team.png" target="_blank">your data science team</a> to best utilize each product so you’re solving problems as quickly and cheaply as possible.

The materials here will help you understand how to choose the set of Azure machine learning and AI products that fit your data science team within a typical machine learning workflow, allowing you to scale, automate, and deploy analytical solutions with ease.

### Machine Learning Options on Azure

 - Azure Machine Learning Service (Preview)
 - Azure Machine Learning Studio (Classic)
 - Azure Databricks
 - Azure Data Science Virtual Machine
 - SQL Server Machine Learning Services

There are a number of machine learning options on Azure that allow data analysts, data engineers, data scientists, and AI engineers work collaboratively on AI and ML models. 

Two of these products -- Azure Machine Learning Service (Preview) and Azure Databricks -- allow you to build models from the ground up. The materials in this repository focus on the services within these two products.
