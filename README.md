# Choosing the Right Data Science Services in Azure
Materials for the Choosing the Right Data Science Services in Azure presentations

## Goal
Choose the right Azure machine learning products and services that allow your team to minimally build, deploy, and operationalize your AI and ML models quickly and cheaply.

### Machine Learning Options on Azure

 - Azure Machine Learning Service (Preview)
 - Azure Machine Learning Studio (Classic)
 - Azure Databricks
 - Azure Data Science Virtual Machine
 - SQL Server Machine Learning Services

There are five machine learning options on Azure that allow data analysts, data engineers, data scientists, and AI engineers work collaboratively on AI and ML models. 

Two of these prodcts -- Azure Machine Learning Service (Preview) and Azure Databricks -- allow you to build models from the ground up. The materials in this repository focus on the services within these two products.
